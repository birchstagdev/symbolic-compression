# 🧠 Symbolic Encoding & Decoding System

This project implements a symbolic, emotion-aware compression and reconstruction system for visual scenes. Rather than storing or recovering pixel data, it captures **how humans perceive and remember** through structure, mood, saliency, and symbolic presence.

---

## 🔍 Project Goal

To build a perceptual encoding and decoding framework that transforms images and video frames into **compact memory-like codes**, and reconstructs them into **symbolic, emotional, and spatial representations** for human-first, ai-ready applications.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- **Perceptual Encoder**
  - Converts input images into 16–32 character symbolic codes
  - Analyzes edge density, color variance, shape recognition, saliency, spatial layout
  - Produces structured metadata alongside the main perceptual string

- **Symbolic Decoder**
  - Interprets perceptual codes into scene descriptions, memory tokens, or scene graphs
  - Supports ambiguous, mood-driven reconstruction (not visual fidelity)
  - Version-aware and configurable for cultural, emotional, or character-specific biases

- **NPC Integration (Optional)**
  - Modified decoders can serve as NPC perception systems
  - NPCs behave based on what they symbolically "see", not omniscient data
  - Enables large-scale, memory-consistent simulated worlds

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Symbolic world streaming in low-fidelity games  
- Scene reconstruction via memory instead of pixels  
- Mood-based storytelling and dream-like playback  
- Human-readable perceptual logs  
- Lightweight vision modules for AI agents

## 📜 Philosophy

This is a **human-first, ai-ready perceptual system**.  
It does not aim for realism or photometric accuracy.  
It aims to **preserve what mattered** and reconstruct **what should be remembered**.
