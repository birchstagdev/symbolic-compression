# üß† Perceptual Alchemy System: Engineering Specification

---

## 1. Scene Complexity Estimation

To dynamically allocate encoding depth:

Let  
- `E_d` = Edge density score  
- `O_c` = Object count  
- `C_v` = Color variance  
- `W ‚àà ‚Ñù` = Weighted complexity score

Then:

    W = Œ±1¬∑E_d + Œ±2¬∑O_c + Œ±3¬∑C_v

Where `Œ±1`, `Œ±2`, `Œ±3` are context-dependent scalars.

Encoding length `L ‚àà {12, 16, 26, 32}` is selected by thresholding `W`.

## 2. Adaptive Symbol Allocation (Encoder Core)

Each character in the perceptual code represents a symbolic feature vector, drawn from:

    Œ£ = {A‚ÄìZ}
    Œ£‚Ä≤ = Œ£ ‚à™ {#, *, ?, 0‚Äì9}

Each position `p·µ¢` in the code:

    p·µ¢ = f(V·µ¢, S·µ¢, M·µ¢)

Where:  
- `V·µ¢`: Visual saliency at region `i`  
- `S·µ¢`: Spatial quadrant or radial sector  
- `M·µ¢`: Mood/affective weighting  
- `f`: Symbol mapping function

---

## 3. Temporal Contextualization (Video Mode)

For encoding across frames:

- `Œî_t = F_t - F_(t-1)` (delta frame)
- `K_t`: Full symbolic keyframe  
- `D_t`: Delta frame (compressed update)  
- `M_t`: Motion vector layer  
- Motion vector format:  
    `[CameraCode | Object1 | Object2 | Object3]`  
- Object vectors: quantized 2-char velocity bins

---

## 4. Cultural & Personal Vocabulary Adaptation

Per-user vocabulary:

    D_u = D_base ‚à™ D_personal ‚à™ D_cultural

Symbol selection depends on salience and familiarity. Updates occur via:

    D_u‚Ä≤ = ùìõ(D_u, I_accepted, I_rejected)

Optional: override to use mythological or poetic mappings.

---

## 5. Multi-Scale Hierarchical Encoding

Three perceptual strata:

- Global: 26 chars  
- Intermediate: 13 chars  
- Fine: 13 chars  

Combined:

    Code = Global ‚äï Intermediate ‚äï Fine

Radial spatial emphasis applied in culture-aware modes.

---

## 6. Decoder Symbol Expansion

Given code `S ‚àà Œ£^L`:

    Scene_Model = ùìì(S) = {O, M, Q, T}

Where:  
- `O`: Objects  
- `M`: Mood  
- `Q`: Focus quadrant or radial orientation  
- `T`: Temporal echoes / memory residue

Decoder includes:

- Mood-spatial graph  
- Concept reconstruction via cultural lens  
- Narrative generation (primary, poetic, archetypal)

---

## 7. Disambiguation & Conflict Resolution

Multiple interpretations scored:

    score(S·µ¢) = sim(S·µ¢, C_s)

Where `C_s` is current context stack.

Lowest-entropy match selected, unless NPC mode is active (bias to memory-emotion correlation).

---

## 8. Versioned Symbol Format

Symbol stream format:

    Code = V_v ‚äï S_d

- `V_v`: Version tag  
- `S_d`: Encoded symbolic string

Supports forward/backward compatibility.

---

## 9. Compression Metrics

Encoding rate:

- ~2.6 KB/minute symbolic  
- ~90 MB/minute video (720p)  
- Compression ratio: ~34,615:1

Designed for mobile, offline memory retrieval, or symbolic AI cognition.

## ‚úÖ System Purpose

This system enables:

- Emotionally biased memory simulation  
- AI agents with symbolic, cultural perception  
- Memory-anchored NPC perception  
- Real-time perceptual compression at negligible bandwidth cost

Perception is no longer pixels ‚Äî it‚Äôs meaning.
