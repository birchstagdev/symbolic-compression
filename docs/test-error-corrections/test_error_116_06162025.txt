This is the block it originated:

    encode(imageData, context = {}) {
        try {
            const result = this.encoder.encode(imageData, context);
            
            if (!this.validator.validate(result.code)) {
                throw new Error(`Invalid encoding produced: ${result.code}`);
            }
            
            // Add to memory buffer
            this.addToMemory({
                code: result.code,
                timestamp: Date.now(),
                context,
                emotion: result.analysis.emotion.current
            });
            
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Encoding failed:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }

At line: perceptual_system.js:71

There might be a bug within the encoding logic itself that results in an output that doesn't conform to the expected format. The output was: ILVÎ´000000000000Z4%AXXOK6KT

I have a feeling its due to the image I uploaded not having metadata because I exported it out of Krita with no metadata.

Going to add debug logs throughout and try to come up with a fix before next test. One big issue with the current implementation is it tries to pull imageData, but it did pass the validator. I have a feeling it's in the memory buffer.
