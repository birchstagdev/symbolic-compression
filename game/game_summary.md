> **A meditation on impermanence, fleeting beauty, and the bittersweet ache of existence.**

## 🎨 Intended Mood and Experience

- **Melancholic realism, existential weight, fleeting beauty.**
- Each session feels like waking up in a world both decaying and alive, where awe and despair are neighbors.
- Lo-fi, retro visuals (think detailed early 3D/“Doom”), but a world lush with atmosphere:  
  **Seasons, light, decay, small joys, and the subtle terror of impermanence.**
- The player is a witness—sometimes participant, mostly observer—of a living, breathing system.
- The tone is not hopeless, but quietly accepting:  
  *Even in rot, there is beauty. Even in endings, there is peace.*
- Every playthrough is unique, irreplaceable—a fragment of a far larger, unknowable story.

## 🕹️ Game Systems Overview

### 1. **One World, Many Random Lives**
- Each session: awaken as a random adult (20–80), somewhere on Earth.  
  _No character creation, no returning to past lives._
- Begin at 6:00 AM, emerging from the haze of a forgotten nightmare—a nod to your prior self.
- When a run ends, that character is gone, forever.

---

### 2. **Real-Time, Season-Driven Progression**
- **1 minute of play = 1 minute in-game.**
- Each session covers part of a day (usually dawn to collapse).
- Every session advances the world’s season; **4 sessions = 1 year.**
- Play for 400 sessions? 100 years pass—world, society, tech, and environment all change.

---

### 3. **Fatigue and the Limits of Existence**
- **Everyone (player & NPCs) feels real fatigue:**
  - Staying awake too long brings slowness, inattentiveness, risk, and collapse.
  - Marathon play (hours/days) leads to hallucinations, micro-sleeps, or sudden endings.
  - The later you push, the more surreal, lonely, and dangerous the world becomes.
- Every decision to rest or risk the body’s needs has genuine consequence.

---

### 4. **World Mood, Rot, and Beauty**
- The world cycles endlessly between decay and renewal:
  - Weather, seasons, and infrastructure reflect time’s passage—buildings crumble, flowers bloom in ruins.
  - Nothing is static; beauty fades and returns in cycles.
  - _Details matter: a sunset over garbage, laughter in a crumbling kitchen, a quiet moment before rain._

---

### 5. **Emergent Events and Living Systems**
- **No written “main story.”**  
  The world is shaped by systemic events and NPC choices:
  - Wars, disasters, epidemics, blackouts, miracles—all possible through NPC actions and systemic interplay.
  - NPCs (humans and animals) live, change, die, and make world-impacting choices—a true butterfly effect.
  - Sometimes you may inhabit an NPC’s old home or find echoes of your past self.
  - The world “remembers”—not with scoreboards, but with subtle environmental and narrative echoes.

---

### 6. **Mood as Safeguard**
- **Long sessions gently discouraged:**  
  Fatigue, surreal events, and a world that “wants” to sleep.
- No popups or nagging—just honest consequence.
- Play forever, and the world grows stranger and harsher, until collapse is inevitable.

---

## 🧭 Purpose and Philosophy

- **To give players a space to experience and accept the ephemeral, fragile nature of existence.**
- **To evoke awe and nostalgia not from spectacle, but from small, lived details:**  
  Loss, hope, rot, and renewal.
- **To ask “What’s the point?” and show meaning must be found, fleetingly, in the cracks of an uncaring world.**
- **To build empathy**—not by saving the world, but by living honestly in it, again and again, always for the last time.

---

## 🌅 The Final Event: The Sun Dies

- As sessions pass, the world ages—technology, society, beauty, and decay continue their dance.
- Eventually, after enough time or according to the world’s own timeline, **the sun will die.**
  - This may be a slow fading, a sudden blackout, or a final blinding sunrise.
- The world freezes, the light goes out, and everything ends—no warning, no reset, no explanation.
- **After the sun’s death, the game locks forever.**
  - No new lives, no returns. That world is over.
  - The only proof of its existence: the memory of the one who played it.

## 📝 What the Player Takes Away

- Every session is a fleeting miracle; every loss, a lesson; every ordinary moment, a secret victory.
- Players are left with the same bittersweet ache as real life:  
  _It’s all going to end, and that’s what makes it matter._
- This is not a power fantasy, nor an escape, but a meditation—  
  a living elegy to the cycle of hope and decay.
- A digital home for those who want to know that even in darkness,  
  there is beauty worth witnessing,  
  and that endings are the most sacred part of the story.
